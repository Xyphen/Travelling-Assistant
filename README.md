# Travelling-Assistant-Android-Application
The idea for this project is to build an application that keeps track of the bus by informing the users about the Real Time
Location of the bus and its routes (Online and Offline). Users can trace the path travelled by the bus in real time and
estimate the arrival or departure of the bus at or from a stop, respectively. They can plan their trips accordingly.
## Implementation:
The real-time location of a vehicle can be tracked using the geolocation determined by an internal GPS integrated inside
the driverâ€™s phone. This information can then be updated on the map in real-time and be accessible to the users.
Caution : Online Location will be right while Offline shown would be
predicted using some ML algorithm.

#### Future Enhancement : More features to come.
